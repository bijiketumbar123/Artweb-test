        <h2>What Even *Is* Art?</h2>
        <p>
            Art isn’t just paintings hanging in fancy galleries. It’s expression — pure emotion turned into shape, sound, color, or movement. 
            It’s the way people show what words can’t. A messy sketch, a moody playlist, a random photo that just *feels* right — that’s art too. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The cool thing is, there’s no rulebook. Art can be beautiful or weird, peaceful or chaotic. It can make you cry or make you confused — 
            and both reactions mean it worked. Because art isn’t about being understood by everyone; it’s about being *felt* by someone.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the day, art is just us — humans — trying to make sense of life in the most creative ways we can.
